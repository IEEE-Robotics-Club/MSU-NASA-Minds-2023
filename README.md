# MSU-NASA-Minds-2023
The code repository for the 2023 MSU NASA Minds competition. This year we will explore different cooperative imformation gathering techniques via simulation and building a homogenous robotic swarm. This repository will be split up into several different sections:

## ARGoS Robotic Swarm Simulator: 

We will be modelling and testing our system methods using ARGoS Robotic Simulator. This will serve the purpose of testing our movement algorithms and swarm logic.  

### Getting Started with ARGoS Simulator on an Ubuntu Machine:

1. Install ARGoS as per directions here https://www.argos-sim.info/core.php 

2. Clone the ARGoS-Simulations Repository and save it in a memorable place. 

3. Navigate to the repository using the terminal and run the command:

  `$ argos3 -c  lua-only/examples/prototype-example.argos`

This will run the example simulation and also open the Lua editor where you can change the Robot's behaviour with a Lua Script.
